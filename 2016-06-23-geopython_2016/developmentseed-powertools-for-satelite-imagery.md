Tools
-----

https://github.com/sat-utils
Oganisation dedicated to satelite tools - keep an eye on this.

https://github.com/sat-utils/landsat8-util
Command line utility for searching, downloading, and processing Landsat-8 data 

https://github.com/sat-utils/sentinel2-util
Command line utility for searching, downloading, and processing Sentinel-2 data 

https://github.com/sat-utils/sat-process
Sat-process is a Python library for processing sensor specific geospatial raster data. Two sensor classes are provided here: landsat8 and sentinel2.

https://github.com/gipit/gippy
Gippy is a Python library for image processing of geospatial raster data. Gippy includes a C++ library, libgip, that encapsulates the functionality of GDAL and CImg, with Python bindings generated with SWIG. Gippy handles issues common to geospatial data, such as handling of nodata values and chunking up of very large images by saving chains of functions and processing image in pieces when finally read. It is reasonably lightweight, requiring only GDAL system libraries and a reasonably modern C++ compiler.

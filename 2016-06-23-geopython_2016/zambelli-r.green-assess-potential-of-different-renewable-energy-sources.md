The tool is organized in the modules r.green.hydro and r.green.biomassfor which are composed of several programs considering different limits (e.g. theoretical, recommended, legal, technical, ecological and economic constraints).
These different scenarios can be compared so that the residual energy potential and the suitable places for constructing a new power plant can be identified.
